        <p>The beach is just an amazing place to be, just listening to the sound of the waves, feeling the cool breeze across my face and my feet emerged into the sand makes me feel so relaxed, peaceful and completely free as though, I am in a magical place so calm and beautiful .</p>

                I was lost in taking pictures when I heard somebody calling me. I looked around and saw that my cousins were already enjoying in the water. I ran fast and dived into the water. We had a great time splashing water on each other, swimming and playing games.

            <p>We were lucky to see some small fishes swimming near the shore. We tried catching them with our hands but they slipped away. My father informed us about the variety of freshwater and saltwater fishes found in seas and oceans. After a while, we came out of the water and had lunch. It was getting hot so we decided to rest for a while under the shade.

            <p>Water pollution is harmful to animals and human alike. Proper steps should be taken to keep the beaches clean and control activities that lead to water pollution. I, on my part, decided to make efforts to keep the beaches clean by avoiding the use of plastic bags and bottles.</p>
